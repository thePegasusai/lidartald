# TALD UNIA Platform

## Overview

TALD UNIA is a revolutionary handheld gaming platform leveraging LiDAR technology to create an interconnected fleet ecosystem. The platform enables unprecedented social gaming experiences through real-time environmental scanning and multi-device mesh networking.

### Key Features
- 30Hz LiDAR scanning with 0.01cm resolution
- 5-meter effective scanning range
- 32-device mesh network support
- Real-time environment synchronization
- Proximity-based social gaming

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. LiDAR Processing Pipeline
   - Real-time point cloud generation
   - GPU-accelerated feature detection
   - Environment classification
   - 30Hz continuous scanning

2. Fleet Ecosystem Framework
   - WebRTC-based mesh networking
   - CRDT-based state synchronization
   - Up to 32 connected devices
   - <50ms network latency

3. Social Gaming Platform
   - Proximity-based discovery
   - Automated fleet formation
   - Real-time environment sharing
   - Persistent world building

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build

# Fleet Manager
cargo build --release

# Social Engine
npm install
npm run build
```

### Testing Framework
